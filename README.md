ShareLaTeX
==========

[ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com) is an open-source online real-time collaborative LaTeX editor. We run a hosted version at http://www.sharelatex.com, but you can also run your own local version, and contribute to the development of ShareLaTeX.

*[If you want help installing and maintaining ShareLaTeX at your university or workplace, we offer an officially supported version called ShareLaTeX Server Pro. It also comes with extra security and admin features. Click here to find out more!](https://www.sharelatex.com/university/onsite.html)*

Installation
------------

We have detailed installation instructions in our wiki:

* [Installing ShareLaTeX in Production](https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex/wiki/Production-Installation-Instructions)
* [Setting up a ShareLaTeX Development Environment](https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex/wiki/Setting-up-a-Development-Environment)

**If you have any problems, have a look at our page of [Frequent Problems and Questions](https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex/wiki/FAQ).**

Upgrading
---------

If you are upgrading from a previous version of ShareLaTeX, please see the [Release Notes section on the Wiki] (https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex/wiki/Home) for all of the versions between your current version and the version you are upgrading to.


Dependencies
------------

ShareLaTeX should run on OS X and Linux. You need:

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) 0.10.x. We recommend that you use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install it.
* The [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) command line tools (Run `npm install -g grunt-cli` to install them)
* A local instance of [Redis](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart) (version 2.6.12 or later) and [MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) running on their standard ports.
* [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) 2013 or later with the `latexmk` program installed.

ShareLaTeX needs a minimum of 2gb of memory, it is likely to be more than that though depending on usage.

Other repositories
------------------

This repository does not contain any code. It acts a wrapper and toolkit for managing the many different ShareLaTeX  services. These each run as their own Node.js process and have their own Github repository. These are all downloaded and set up when you run `grunt install`

The different services are:

### [web](https://github.com/sharelatex/web-sharelatex) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sharelatex/web-sharelatex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sharelatex/web-sharelatex)

The front facing web server that serves all the HTML pages, CSS and JavaScript
to the client. Also contains a lot of logic around creating and editing
projects, and account management.

### [document-updater](https://github.com/sharelatex/document-updater-sharelatex) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sharelatex/document-updater-sharelatex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sharelatex/document-updater-sharelatex)

Processes updates that come in from the editor when users modify documents. Ensures that
the updates are applied in the right order, and that only one operation is modifying
the document at a time. Also caches the documents in redis for very fast but persistent
modifications.

### [CLSI](https://github.com/sharelatex/clsi-sharelatex) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sharelatex/clsi-sharelatex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sharelatex/clsi-sharelatex)

The Common LaTeX Service Interface (CLSI) which provides an API for compiling LaTeX 
documents.

### [docstore](https://github.com/sharelatex/docstore-sharelatex) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sharelatex/docstore-sharelatex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sharelatex/docstore-sharelatex)

An API for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on text files
stored in ShareLaTeX.

### [filestore](https://github.com/sharelatex/filestore-sharelatex) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sharelatex/filestore-sharelatex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sharelatex/filestore-sharelatex)

An API for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on binary files
(like images) stored in ShareLaTeX.

### [track-changes](https://github.com/sharelatex/track-changes-sharelatex) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sharelatex/track-changes-sharelatex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sharelatex/track-changes-sharelatex)

An API for compressing and storing the updates applied to a document, and then rendering a diff of the changes
between any two time points.

### [chat](https://github.com/sharelatex/chat-sharelatex) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sharelatex/chat-sharelatex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sharelatex/chat-sharelatex)

The backend API for storing and fetching chat messages.

### [tags](https://github.com/sharelatex/tags-sharelatex) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sharelatex/tags-sharelatex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sharelatex/tags-sharelatex)
