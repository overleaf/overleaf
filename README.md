## Community Edition

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is an open-source online real-time collaborative LaTeX editor. We run a hosted version at [www.overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com), but you can also run your own local version, and contribute to the development of Overleaf.

## Enterprise

If you want help installing and maintaining Overleaf in your lab or workplace, we offer an officially supported version called [Overleaf Server Pro](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises). It also includes more features for security (SSO with LDAP or SAML), administration and collaboration (e.g. tracked changes). [Find out more!](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises)

## Keeping up to date

Sign up to the [mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/overleaf.com/community-edition-and-server-pro) to get updates on Overleaf releases and development.

## Installation

We have detailed installation instructions in the [Overleaf Toolkit](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit/).

## Upgrading

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Overleaf, please see the [Release Notes section on the Wiki](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki#release-notes) for all of the versions between your current version and the version you are upgrading to.

## Overleaf Docker Image

This repo contains two dockerfiles, [`Dockerfile-base`](server-ce/Dockerfile-base), which builds the
`sharelatex/sharelatex-base` image, and [`Dockerfile`](server-ce/Dockerfile) which builds the
`sharelatex/sharelatex` (or "community") image.

The Base image generally contains the basic dependencies like `wget`, plus `texlive`.
We split this out because it's a pretty heavy set of
dependencies, and it's nice to not have to rebuild all of that every time.

The `sharelatex/sharelatex` image extends the base image and adds the actual Overleaf code
and services.

Use `make build-base` and `make build-community` from `server-ce/` to build these images.

We use the [Phusion base-image](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker)
(which is extended by our `base` image) to provide us with a VM-like container
in which to run the Overleaf services. Baseimage uses the `runit` service
manager to manage services, and we add our init-scripts from the `server-ce/runit`
folder.
