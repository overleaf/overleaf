## Key Features

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is an open-source online real-time collaborative LaTeX editor. We run a hosted version at http://www.overleaf.com, but you can also run your own local version, and contribute to the development of Overleaf.

*[If you want help installing and maintaining Overleaf at your university or workplace, we offer an officially supported version called Overleaf Server Pro. It also comes with extra security and admin features. Click here to find out more!](https://www.overleaf.com/university/onsite.html)*

## Other repositories

This repository does not contain any code. It acts a wrapper and toolkit for managing the many different Overleaf  services. These each run as their own Node.js process and have their own Github repository. These are all downloaded and set up when you run `grunt install`

| Service | Description | 
| ------- | ----------- |
| **[web](https://github.com/overleaf/web)** | The front facing web server that serves all the HTML pages, CSS and JavaScript to the client. Also contains a lot of logic around creating and editing projects, and account management. |
| **[document-updater](https://github.com/overleaf/document-updater)** | Processes updates that come in from the editor when users modify documents. Ensures that the updates are applied in the right order, and that only one operation is modifying the document at a time.
