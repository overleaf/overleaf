	# Databases
	# ---------

	# ShareLaTeX's main persistant data store is MongoDB (http://www.mongodb.org/)
	# Documentation about the URL connection string format can be found at:
	#
	#    http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/connection-string/
	# 
	# The following works out of the box with Mongo's default settings:
	mongo:
		url : 'mongodb://127.0.0.1/sharelatex'

	# Redis is used in ShareLaTeX for high volume queries, like real-time
	# editing, and session management.
	#
	# The following config will work with Redis's default settings:
	redis:
		web:
			host: "localhost"
			port: "6379"
			password: ""

	# The compile server (the clsi) uses a SQL database to cache files and
	# meta-data. sqllite is the default, and the load is low enough that this will
	# be fine in production (we use sqllite at sharelatex.com).
	#
	# If you want to configure a different database, see the Sequelize documentation
	# for available options:
	#
	#    https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/wiki/API-Reference-Sequelize#example-usage
	#
	mysql:
		clsi:
			database: "clsi"
			username: "clsi"
			password: ""
			dialect: "sqlite"
			storage: Path.join(DATA_DIR, "db.sqlite")

	# File storage
	# ------------

	# ShareLaTeX can store binary files like images either locally or in Amazon
	# S3. The default is locally:
	filestore:
		backend: "fs"	
		stores:
			user_files: Path.join(DATA_DIR, "user_files")
			
	# To use Amazon S3 as a storage backend, comment out the above config, and
	# uncomment the following, filling in your key, secret, and bucket name:
	#
	#filestore:
	#	backend: "s3"
	#	stores:
	#		user_files: "BUCKET_NAME"
	#	s3:
	#		key: "AWS_KEY"
	#		secret: "AWS_SECRET"
	# 		

	# Local disk caching
	# ------------------
	path:
		# If we ever need to write something to disk (e.g. incoming requests
		# that need processing but may be too big for memory), then write
		# them to disk here:
		dumpFolder:   Path.join(TMP_DIR, "dumpFolder")
		# Where to write uploads before they are processed
		uploadFolder: Path.join(TMP_DIR, "uploads")
		# Where to write the project to disk before running LaTeX on it
		compilesDir:  Path.join(DATA_DIR, "compiles")
		# Where to cache downloaded URLs for the CLSI
		clsiCacheDir: Path.join(DATA_DIR, "cache")

	# Server Config
	# -------------

	# Where your instance of ShareLaTeX can be found publicly. This is used
	# when emails are sent out and in generated links:
	siteUrl : 'http://localhost:3000'
	
	# The websocket layer of ShareLaTeX runs as separate service.
	# When running locally or in development, you can point the client to this
	# service directly on port 3026. If you are running behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, etc)
	# then websocketsUrl should be the same as siteUrl, with your reverse
	# proxy responible for sending websocket traffic to the websocket service
	# rather than connecting directly.
	websocketsUrl: 'http://localhost:3026'
	
	# If provided, a sessionSecret is used to sign cookies so that they cannot be
	# spoofed. This is recommended.
	security:
		sessionSecret: "CRYPTO_RANDOM" # This was randomly generated for you

	# These credentials are used for authenticating api requests
	# between services that may need to go over public channels
	httpAuthUsers: httpAuthUsers
	
	# Should javascript assets be served minified or not. Note that you will
	# need to run `grunt compile:minify` within the web-sharelatex directory
	# to generate these.
	useMinifiedJs: false

	# Should static assets be sent with a header to tell the browser to cache
	# them. This should be false in development where changes are being made,
	# but should be set to true in production.
	cacheStaticAssets: false

	# If you are running ShareLaTeX over https, set this to true to send the
	# cookie with a secure flag (recommended).
	secureCookie: false
	
	# If you are running ShareLaTeX behind a proxy (like Apache, Nginx, etc)
	# then set this to true to allow it to correctly detect the forwarded IP
	# address and http/https protocol information.
	behindProxy: false

	# Sending Email
	# -------------
	#
	# You must configure a mail server to be able to send invite emails from
	# ShareLaTeX. The config settings are passed to nodemailer. See the nodemailer
	# documentation for available options:
	#
	#     http://www.nodemailer.com/docs/transports
	#
	# email:
	#	fromAddress: ""
	#	replyTo: ""
	#	transport: "SES"
	#	parameters:
	#		AWSAccessKeyID: ""
	#		AWSSecretKey: ""

	# Spell Check Languages
	# ---------------------
	#
	# You must have the corresponding aspell dictionary installed to 
	# be able to use a language. Run `grunt check:aspell` to check which
	# dictionaries you have installed. These should be set for the `code` for
	# each language.
	languages: [
		{name: "English", code: "en"}
	]
	
	# Service locations
	# -----------------

	# ShareLaTeX is comprised of many small services, which each expose
	# an HTTP API running on a different port. Generally you
	# can leave these as they are unless you have some other services
	# running which conflict, or want to run the web process on port 80.
	#internal:
	#	web:
	#		port: webPort = 3000
	#		host: "localhost"
	#	documentupdater:
	#		port: docUpdaterPort = 3003
	#		host: "localhost"
	#	filestore:
	#		port: filestorePort = 3009
	#		host: "localhost"
	#	chat:
	#		port: chatPort = 3010
	#		host: "localhost"
	#	tags:
	#		port: tagsPort = 3012
	#		host: "localhost"
	#	clsi:
	#		port: clsiPort = 3013
	#		host: "localhost"
	#	trackchanges:
	#		port: trackchangesPort = 3015
	#		host: "localhost"
	#	docstore:
	#		port: docstorePort = 3016
	#		host: "localhost"
	#	spelling:
	# 		port: spellingPort = 3005
	#		host: "localhost"
	#	realTime:
	#		port: realTimeport = 3026
	#		host: "localhost"

	# If you change the above config, or run some services on remote servers,
	# you need to tell the other services where to find them:
	apis:
		web:
			url: "http://localhost:3000"
			user: httpAuthUser
			pass: httpAuthPass
	#	documentupdater:
	#		url : "http://localhost:#{docUpdaterPort}"
	#	clsi:
	#		url: "http://localhost:#{clsiPort}"
	#	filestore:
	#		url: "http://localhost:#{filestorePort}"
	#	trackchanges:
	#		url: "http://localhost:#{trackchangesPort}"
	#	docstore:
	#		url: "http://localhost:#{docstorePort}"
	#	tags:
	#		url: "http://localhost:#{tagsPort}"
	#	spelling:
	#		url: "http://localhost:#{spellingPort}"
	#	chat:
	#		url: "http://localhost:#{chatPort}"
	

# With lots of incoming and outgoing HTTP connections to different services,
# sometimes long running, it is a good idea to increase the default number
# of sockets that Node will hold open.
