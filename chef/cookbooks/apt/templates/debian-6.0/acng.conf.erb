# Usually, general purpose proxies like Squid expose the IP adress of the
# client user to the remote server using the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header. This
# behaviour can be optionally turned on with the Expose-Origin option.
# ExposeOrigin: 0

# When logging the originating IP address, trust the information supplied by

# The version string reported to the peer, to be displayed as HTTP client (and
# version) in the logs of the mirror.
# WARNING: some archives use this header to detect/guess capabilities of the
# client (i.e. redirection support) and change the behaviour accordingly, while
# ACNG might not support the expected features. Expect side effects.
#
# UserAgent: Yet Another HTTP Client/1.2.3p4

# In some cases the Import and Expiration tasks might create fresh volatile
# data for internal use by reconstructing them using patch files. This
# by-product might be recompressed with bzip2 and with some luck the resulting
# file becomes identical to the *.bz2 file on the server, usable for APT
# clients trying to fetch the full .bz2 compressed version. Injection of the
# generated files into the cache has however a disadvantage on underpowered
# servers: bzip2 compession can create high load on the server system and the
# visible download of the busy .bz2 files also becomes slower.

# RecompBz2: 0

# Network timeout for outgoing connections.
# NetworkTimeout: 60

# Sometimes it makes sense to not store the data in cache and just return the
# package data to client as it comes in. DontCache parameters can enable this
# behaviour for certain URL types. The tokens are extended regular expressions
# that URLs are matched against.
#
# DontCacheRequested is applied to the URL as it comes in from the client.
# Example: exclude packages built with kernel-package for x86
# DontCacheRequested: linux-.*_10\...\.Custo._i386
# Example usecase: exclude popular private IP ranges from caching
# DontCacheRequested: 192.168.0 ^10\..* 172.30
#
# DontCacheResolved is applied to URLs after mapping to the target server. If
# multiple backend servers are specified then it's only matched against the
# download link for the FIRST possible source (due to implementation limits).
# Example usecase: all Ubuntu stuff comes from a local mirror (specified as
# backend), don't cache it again:
# DontCacheResolved: ubuntumirror.local.net
#
# DontCache directive sets (overrides) both, DontCacheResolved and
# DontCacheRequested.  Provided for convenience, see those directives for
# details.
#
# Default permission set of freshly created files and directories, as octal
# numbers (see chmod(1) for details).
# Can by limited by the umask value (see umask(2) for details) if it's set in
# the environment of the starting shell, e.g. in apt-cacher-ng init script or
# in its configuration file.
