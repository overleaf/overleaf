Contributing to ShareLaTeX
==========================

Thank you for reading this! If you'd like to report a bug or join in the development
of ShareLaTeX, then here are some notes on how to do that.

*Note that ShareLaTeX is actually made up of many separate repositories (a list is available
[here](https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex/blob/master/README.md#other-repositories)).* 

Reporting bugs and opening issues
---------------------------------

If you'd like to report a bug or open an issue then please:

1. **Find the correct repository.** ShareLaTeX is split across multiple different repositories, each containing a different service (you can find a list of [all repositories here](https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex/blob/master/README.md#other-repositories)). If you know the bug only applies to one service, then please open an issue in that repository. For general bugs and issues that span more than one service, please open an issue in the [sharelatex/sharelatex](https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex) repository.
2. **Check if there is an existing issue.** If there is then please add
   any more information that you have, or give it a üëç.

When submitting an issue please describe the issue as clearly as possible, including how to
reproduce the bug, which situations it appears in, what you expected to happen, and what actually happens.
If you can include a screenshot for front end issues that is very helpful.

Pull Requests
-------------

See [our wiki](https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex/wiki)

We love pull requests, so be bold with them! Don't be afraid of going ahead
and changing something, or adding a new feature. We're very happy to work with you
to get your changes merged into ShareLaTeX.

If you're looking for something to work on, have a look at the open issues in any of the repositories listed [here](https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex/blob/master/README.md#other-repositories).

Security
--------

to address them. All security related issues/patches should be sent directly to
security@overleaf.com where we will attempt to address them quickly. If you're
